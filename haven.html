                            During an ongoing crisis, some refugees have settled in Seattle. Aid to
                            ease the transition is available but scattered and hard to find. Safe
                            Haven aims to bridge the disconnect between resources and people
                            who need them.

                            When presented with a project theme of “back to whatever this is,”
                            which explores technology in the context of the “new normal,” our
                            team considered how we can help an underserved community growing in number.
                            Due to course contraints, my team focused our user-centered design on
                            people we had access to: those who have heard about the
                            Afghan refugee crisis on the news and <strong>
                                want to help but don’t know

                            We began the project by conducting <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong>
                            coupled with <strong>surveys</strong> with adults who are aware of the refugee
                            crisis and have an interest in volunteering to understand their time, and
                            involvement, and transportation concerns as it relates to organizations
                            supporting incoming refugees.
                            We also conducted <strong>discovery interviews</strong> with volunteers
                            and caseworkers from refugee relief organizations such as International
                            Rescue Committee (IRC) and Jewish Family Services (JFS) to participate
                            in discovery interviews before conducting a <strong>Competative Analysis</strong>
                            to find existing solutions within this space. <br><br>While job boards and
                            volunteer portals exist for official nonprofits, those who have gotten
                            involved did so after a call to action from someone in their network. Our <strong>
                                target
                                audience

                            willing to help incoming refugees but are not actively
                            looking for opportunities nor are they connected with the refugee community.

                            deciding to focus on the issue of <strong>low awareness</strong> around opportunities, we organized our
                            stakeholders into two groups: potential volunteers and existing organizations. We found:

                            From this, I was able to empathize with Casey's schedule and where she can offer support.

                            Early on in the quarter, the team faced a choice between two possible projects: one would be straightforward, with easy access to target users and a fairly clear array of possible design solutions. The other became Safe Haven. At the outset, we were hesitant to pursue this project because of the potential difficulty of engaging stakeholders and the uncertainty over what a possible design solution might look like. But when it came time to choose, we were unanimous: we all wanted to pursue a purposeful, impact-driven project.<br><br>
                            While not without its challenges, choosing this path was immensely rewarding, both in the experiences it led to and the lessons learned from those experiences. Among those lessons, maybe the most important was that the value of human-centered design is not just in the creation of more appropriate and usable design solutions that result from the involvement of users, but in the generative power of design as a process to bring together diverse stakeholders in pursuit of more inspiring and inclusive futures.
