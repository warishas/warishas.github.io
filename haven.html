                            <br>


                            Decades of conflict in Afghanistan have contributed to a growing global refugee crisis
                            where Afghan men, women, and children have left their home country
                            because of war, natural disaster, or political upheaval, resettle in the United States.
                            While aid is scattered and hard to find, there exists a major opportunity
                            for communities to work alongside local refugee relief
                            organizations and government agencies to support and welcome resettled individuals and families.<br><br>



                            In response, Safe Haven is a digital volunteer board application that aims to bridge the
                            disconnect between resources available to support Afghan refugees
                            and individuals who want to help those in transition. The digital screens
                            are situated in high traffic, high visibility bus shelters as a way of bringing opportunities to the community.

                            Surveys taught us that locals have seen breaking news about the crisis
                            in Afghanistan but feel uninformed about
                            the subsequent refugee displacement. While our audience of young professionals do not seek
                            out ways to help, they are open to doing so if the opportunity presents itself.<br /><br />
                            By placing touch-screen kiosks at bus stops where people are already waiting, users are able to learn more
                            and provide support in a manner and location that is convenient to them.

                            <br>
                            We began the project by conducting <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong>
                            coupled with <strong>surveys</strong> with adults who are aware of the refugee
                            crisis and have an interest in volunteering to understand their time, and
                            involvement, and transportation concerns as it relates to organizations
                            supporting incoming refugees.<br><br>

                            The data represented a disconnect between action and intention thus
                            leading me to consider designing for behavior change.

                            looking for opportunities nor are they connected with the refugee community.

                            Combining findings from multiple user research methods using an affinity diagram,
                            my team broke down findings into topics to select the scope of our project. After
                            deciding to focus on the issue of <strong>low awareness</strong> around ways to help asylum seekers, we organized our
                            stakeholders into two groups: potential volunteers and existing organizations.
                            <br><br>
                            I created two <strong>personas</strong> that embodied the archetypes of
                            our user groups. I then mapped out the <strong>user journey</strong> of our primary persona,
                            Casey, including her thoughts and feelings surrounding news coverage about the crisis in Afghanistan.
                            From this, I was able to empathize with Casey's schedule and where she can offer support.

                            strong marketing. Knowing that we wanted to encourage a behavior change,
                            we considered how a kiosk at a bus stop could help people evalute their
                            opportunities while they wait for their ride.

                            My team and I further
                            considered the feasability of a donation option. I was considering different designs for the kiosk hardware as
                            well as the digital screens but we came to the concensus that security at a publicly
                            accessible kisok would put the user at risk (in more ways then one).

                            <br /> <br />
                            We did not want to add a kiosk to the card reader for safety reasons. Knowing that over
                            90% of our discovery survey respondants were inclined to donate money, we decided to make
                            to continue the experience from a
                            mobile device where donations would be safer and the experience could be
                            continued while on public transport.

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            The Safe Haven team sought to test and validate the core â€˜Get Involvedâ€™
                            pathway of the digital board with five participants. The goals of the testing
                            focused on the screen-to-screen experience from the initial default â€˜Homeâ€™ to
                            â€˜Opportunitiesâ€™ screen to discover usability improvements.<br><br>

                            As a result, we made four design changes: <strong>First</strong>, the header text
                            was adjusted and learning content added to the
                            home screen to provide context for users to help grab the attention of users while
                            drawing them into both â€˜Learnâ€™ and â€˜Get Involvedâ€™ pathways with information to lay
                            the groundwork.
                            <strong>Second</strong>, the search bar within the "Get Involved" pathway was removed to reduce
                            complexity. <strong>Third</strong>, to add clarity to the QR code section, text was adjusted from
                            "share with my phone" to "continue with my phone." <strong>Finally</strong>, a label was added to
                            draw attention to filters.<br><br><br>

                            <br>
                            At the outset, my team and I were hesitant to pursue a project on the ongoing crisis
                            because of the langage barrier and packed schedule of stakeholders. Unanimously, however, we chose to pursue purposeful, impact-driven work.<br><br>
                            While not without its challenges, choosing this path was immensely rewarding, both in the experiences it
                            led to and the lessons learned from those experiences. Among those lessons, maybe the
                            most important was that the value of human-centered design is not just in the creation
                            of more appropriate and usable design solutions that result from the involvement of
                            users, but in the generative power of design as a process to bring together diverse
                            stakeholders in pursuit of more inspiring and inclusive futures.
                            Stakeholders wanted to help us help the communities they serve.
