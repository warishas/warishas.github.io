                            At Mosaic, I was responsible for an ambitious challenge - digitizing a process traditionally done over fax by creating a feature to revolutionize housing plan change communication. Despite not being fully implemented, the project pushed our product team beyond our comfort zones, fostering an unmatched rate of learning and leaving a lasting impact on teams and products.

                            The primary goal was to seamlessly integrated with trade partners' current workflows, eliminating disruptions and unnecessary tools resulting in crystal-clear instructions to trades, ensuring timely resource deliveries and accurate content updates while minimizing wasted time and resources.
