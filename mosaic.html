                        <p>
                            <br>
                            Mosaic is a Series B, tech-enabled general contractor for the residential development industry merging technology
                            with construction services. I wore multiple hats within the software side over the course of my internship:
                            conducting interviews, writing product documents, and making design
                            iterations for a quick turnaround following feedback from users. Primarily, I worked on two new features for our
                            company's construction management software.<br><br>

                            My main project was around understanding expectations our partners in the construction industry
                            have for the technology we build and needfinding areas of improvement within our current system.
                            I went through the entire design process from discovery to design with a little bit of testing
                            sprinkled in.<br><br>

                            <strong>Unfortunately, I can't show my final design work here, but don't hesitate to contact me to discuss my project!</strong>

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            My internship was scoped to focus on bringing trade partner interests into the design of our management
                            tool but a solution can't be built without first knowing the problem. I was brought on to
                            needfind and design accordingly with the full support of the company's technology and
                            construction teams. <br><br>To date, this is the role that pushed me to grow the most as a designer.
                            Not only was I working in tabular data for the first time but the efficiency
                            required of this use case meant thinking critically about how the sequence that brings a user to a
                            page affects what they see. For me, this brought new meaning to user centered design.

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            <a>Chris, Supervising Designer - </a><br>
                            Mosaic's technology platform isn't one I was familiar with before joining the team.
                            On top of getting me up to speed on what we do and how we do it, Chris coached me on
                            intentional design, critiqued my progress, and had the company excited about what
                            I was working on - which was so helpful when it came time to workshopping which user
                            needs would be made into features.

                            <br><br><a>Richard, Senior Designer - </a><br>
                            Fun fact, Richard and I onboarded on the same day and by following his lead,
                            I learned how useful flowcharts and diagrams are for a new hire to get acquinted with
                            what company tools do and who uses them.
                            When I took on an additional project, we ended up working closely together. His questions
                            often stumped me and made me realize I needed to think more critically about
                            user journeys.

                            <br><br><a>Maia, Project Manager - </a><br>
                            You know those PM's that do their job so well you can't help but (1) be grateful to
                            them for making your job easier and (2) be in awe? That's Maia.

                            <br><br><a>Cole, Director of Product - </a><br>
                            As I got closer to wrapping up my internship, I began supporting Cole on checking off
                            some low hanging fruits. I also took on some PM responsibilities during and together
                            we finalized the integration of help desk software.

                            <br><a>Weeks 1-2</a><br>
                            Got familiar with the company, project scope, and interviewed
                            internal stakeholders for more context.

                            <br><br><a>Weeks 3-8</a><br>
                            Drafted a research plan, interviewed trade partners, and synthesized
                            findings. I also took on another project digitalizing a process
                            traditionally done on paper.

                            <br><br><a>Weeks 8-12</a><br>
                            Prototyped my primary project, stepped in to support a PM on leave,
                            designed a search feature to organize dashboard for desktop user and
                            prototyped iterations to improve mobile UI.

                            <a>Know Your User</a><br>
                            Mosaic's management tool has a few different types of users
                            with varying permissions. It is important to make sure designs
                            can be accessible by the target user with varying permissions
                            across user groups. This means being intentional about who
                            will be using this design. The next part is to know exactly what
                            the user intends to accomplish. It helps to work backwards
                            from here to clearly identify the parts of the user journey.

                            Feedback is a crucial step in strengthening design skills.
                            What I loved most about working at Mosaic was the balance
                            between independence and collaboration where both designers
                            senior to me were open to talk through designs with me. These
                            were valuable teachable moments that saved me so much time once
                            I learned how to properly use auto layout. I'm embarrassed to
                            tell you how I was designing tables before.
                            <br><br>
                            <a>Keep Others Informed</a><br>
                            Whenever you have the chance, communicate what you're working on
                            to those outside of your immediate team - especially if your work
                            affects them. This gives stakeholders an opportunity to share
                            perspectives you may not have considered or share information you
                            were unaware of. Since the world of construction and it's management
                            was entirely new to me, this was especially necessary to ensure
                            I was <strong>designing with my audience rather than for my audience</strong>.
