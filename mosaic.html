                        <p>
                            <br>
                            Mosaic is a Series B, tech-enabled general contractor for the residential development industry merging technology
                            with construction services. I wore multiple hats accross design, research, and mangement over the course of my contract.
                            While I was offered FTE, I made the decision to accept a scholarship to study Arabic while pursuing my masters degree. <br><br>

                            My main project was understanding expectations our partners in the construction industry
                            have for the technology we build and needfinding areas of improvement within our current system.
                            I went through the entire design process from discovery to prototyping.<br><br>

                            <strong>While, I can't show my final design work, please don't hesitate to contact me to discuss my work.</strong>

                            <br><a>Weeks 1-2</a><br>
                            Got familiar with the company, project scope, and interviewed
                            internal stakeholders for more context.

                            <br><br><a>Weeks 3-8</a><br>
                            Drafted a research plan, interviewed trade partners, and synthesized
                            findings. I also took on another project digitalizing a process
                            traditionally done on paper.

                            <br><br><a>Weeks 8-12</a><br>
                            Prototyped my primary project, stepped in to support a PM on leave,
                            designed a search feature to organize dashboard for desktop user and
                            prototyped iterations to improve mobile UI.

                            <a>Failure to Plan is a Plan to Fail</a><br>
                            After working in tabular data for the first time, I realized my
                            design process needed a facelift. <strong>Prioritizing
                            user journeys and flow charts made all the difference.</strong>
                            Mosaic's management tool has a few different types of users
                            with varying permissions and goals when using the product.
                            It was important to make sure
                            interactions cater to the role of the user. Richard's advice:
                            work backwards
                            from a completed task to map how user goals
                            affect their interactions and journey. My process for
                            joining an existing product team has since
                            adapted to begin by mapping my impression of the user's journey
                            and discussing it with the person it represents.
                            <br><br>
                            <a>Keep Others Informed</a><br>
                            Whenever you have the chance, communicate what you're working on
                            to those outside of your immediate team - especially if your work
                            affects them. This gives stakeholders an opportunity to share
                            perspectives you may not have considered or share information you
                            were unaware of. Since the world of construction and it's management
                            was entirely new to me, this was especially necessary to ensure
                            I was designing with my audience rather than making assumptions
                            on their behalf. I'm making it a habit to share simple recordings
                            over Slack to keep communication open.
                            <br><br>
                            <a>Co-work When You Can</a><br>
                            What I loved most about working at Mosaic was the open door
                            policy across the whole company. The designers on our team
                            were always open to coworking after a feedback session.
                            These turned out to be
                            valuable teachable moments that saved me so much time once
                            Chris showed me how he uses auto layout. I'm embarrassed to
                            tell you how I was designing tables before. On the flip side,
                            I was able to pay forward a Figma shortcut I learned
                            from a peer from a previous organization. (If there are many
                            layers of nesting,
                            you can use cmnd + click to deep select a nested layer
                            without needing to navigate to the layers panel)
