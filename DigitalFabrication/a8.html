    <h1>Digital Fabrication Final</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        For my final project, I have
        chosen to design and digitally fabricate a versatile and
        functional open box specifically intended to house coasters
        and their corresponding connectors. Utilizing the skills and
        techniques acquired throughout the course, this project will be
        created through a combination of laser cutting, 3D printing, molding
        and Fusion 360 in place of Rhino. The intent is to use this as a
        testing environment that can be recreated for an open concept
        kitchen where coasters can be connected to make more sizes.
    </p><br>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Box</h2>
        <p>For my final project, I designed and laser cut an open box with finger joints, intended to hold coasters and coaster connectors. The box is designed to be easily accessible, making it suitable for a kitchen setting. Initially, I created a larger box with a top, but I revised the design to be more practical for everyday use.</p>
        <p><strong>Design Specifications:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Width: 8 inches</li>
            <li>Depth: 8 inches</li>
            <li>Height: 4 inches</li>
            <li>Material Thickness: 0.01 inches (measured using calipers)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Design Process:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initial Concept:</strong> The original design included a top cover and larger dimensions, which proved to be impractical for the intended use in a kitchen.</li>
            <li><strong>Revised Design:</strong> To enhance accessibility, I removed the top cover and adjusted the size to a more compact and manageable 8x8x4 inches.</li>
            <li><strong>Finger Joints:</strong> The box features finger joints for strong and durable assembly. The precise fitting of these joints was ensured by measuring the material thickness with calipers.</li>
            <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong> The material chosen for this project was 0.01 inches thick</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Fabrication Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Designing the Box:</strong> I used a template from Cuttle.xyz to create the 2D design of the box. This platform allowed for easy manipulation of the design, ensuring accurate dimensions and finger joint placement.</li>
            <li><strong>Laser Cutting:</strong> The design was exported to the laser cutter software, where I adjusted settings for the 0.01-inch thick material. The laser cutter was used to cut the box pieces according to the design. It may or may not have burned in one of the finger joints.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> The cut pieces were then carefully assembled using the finger joints. The precise cuts ensured a snug fit, eliminating the need for additional adhesives.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Adjustments:</strong> After assembling the box, I checked for any rough edges or misalignments and made minor adjustments to ensure a smooth finish.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
        <p>The final product is a sleek, functional open box that fits perfectly in a kitchen setting. The dimensions and open design make it easy to reach in and retrieve items, while the finger joint construction provides durability. This project not only showcases the practical application of laser cutting and precise measurement but also demonstrates the iterative design process necessary for creating a user-friendly product. All source files and detailed instructions for replicating this box are documented on my webpage.</p>

        <h2>Coaster</h2>
        <p>For the coaster part of my project, I worked with a hexagon mold designed at an angle to add a unique touch. The process involved several steps:</p>
        <p><strong>Design and Fabrication Steps:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>3D Printing the Mold:</strong> I used a pre-designed hexagon mold with angled sides. The mold was 3D printed to ensure precise dimensions and angles.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating the Silicone Mold:</strong> Using the 3D printed mold, I prepared an Oomoo mixture to create a flexible silicone mold. I struggled with the consistency of the silicone mold, so to prevent anything from getting stuck, I added plastic wrap on top of the silicone and made sure to oil my mold base every time I used it. This step required careful mixing and pouring to avoid air bubbles and ensure a smooth finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Making the Coasters:</strong> After the silicone mold cured, I used it to cast the coasters. I mixed plaster of Paris and poured it into the silicone mold, allowing it to set and harden.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Initially, I intended for the coasters to connect together seamlessly. However, I discovered that the angled design prevented them from fitting together as planned. Despite this, the individual coasters have a unique and appealing look, making them practical and aesthetically pleasing on their own.</p>

        <p><strong>Files:</strong></p>
        <p>Here are the code files used for this project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="a8_basehex.stl">I call it the puck. This is a print of the angled hexagon with full fill.</a></li>
            <li><a href="a8_forplas.stl">This is the mold for the puck. I greased the print very thoroughly before adding plaster but was unable to remove it</a></li>
            <li><a href="a8_forsil.stl">This is the mold for the mold.</a></li>
            <li><a href="a8_hexagon.stl">I thought this was a two part mold. It was not.</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>



    <div class="section">
        <h2>Connector</h2>
        <p>Here, I origionally planned to have connectors to piece the coasters together but because the outcome was more organic in shape, this was not possible for me. Instead, I designed a stand on Rhino for the coasters to rest on inside the box.</p>
