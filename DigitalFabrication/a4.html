            <h2>New Tools for a Prior Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                In my physical prototyping course last year, I designed a lamp called "Andalusia – Journey Within" inspired by spoken word where the artist stated, "put a man in darkness and the light can be seen." As a craftsperson, I am a believer that light transforms art, and seeking that we will be making lamps in the next assignment, I wanted to recreate something I had already worked on because, to be very honest, my approach to digital fabrication is to iterate until something works *well enough*.
            </p>
            <p>
                This lamp display is designed to create a serene and contemplative environment, reminiscent of the teachings of philosophers of Spain’s Golden age – also known as alAndalus. The purpose of this display is to encourage meditation and mindfulness in a yoga-studio style setting. Through carefully crafted cutouts on the lamp shades, the light projected onto the walls forms intricate patterns inspired by philosophers like Ibn Battuta, Ibn Arabi, Averroes, Ibn Hazm, Al-Ghazali, and Ibn Sina. This project aims to merge art, philosophy, and illumination, creating an atmosphere that fosters introspection and self-discovery. The purpose is to create much-needed spaces to disconnect from external stimuli and prototype a tool for reflection by implementing lighting that can dim out the world around using laser cut art as a tool and visual guide.
