        <h2>Mold of a Mold</h2>
        <p>
            Origionally, I thought "mold of a mold" meant finding a mold on Thingiverse
            and making a CAD mold of it. I chose a soap mold and ended up printing a brick
            for my test print. While I followed of tutorial of a two part mold, I did not
            print them as seperate pieces. <br /><br /> I tried again, this time creating a
            mold of a sphere but stuggled with the leveling of my 3D printer and was unable to print.

        <h2>Thingiverse Mold</h2>
        <p>
            I used Thingiverse to print coasters for my final project
            and used those prints for my new, two part mold. I didn't know
            what I was doing, so I just started doing something.<br /><br /> I
            had two sets of prints: a base shape and the container for it (black) and
            an angled mold with a container for it (white). For the purposed of this assignment,
            this would suffice as a two part mold - or so I thought.

        <h2>Casting Round 1</h2>
        <p>
            I greased up my molds and cast, only to find my plaster stuck into
            the black mold. For the duration of the assingment, this was useless
            and I ended up throwing it away. <br /> <img src="a6Slide2.png alt=""><br />

            <br />
            For the white molds, I cast them, realized I created a brick and a mold.

        <h2>Casting Part 2</h2>
        <p>
            Since I didn't know what I was doing the first time around, I did
            the same thing again hoping for a different result.

        <p>
            When that didn't work, I decided to create a makeshift,
            two-part mold by using two molds casted from the same peice and
            laying them on top of eachother. What I ended up with is a coaster
            of double thickness and it looks like two seperate pieces were
            glued together when they were, in fact, plastered as one. <bold>I will take the L on this one.</bold>
