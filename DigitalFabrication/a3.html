  <h1>3D Printing Documentation</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">I'm playing around with different styles of web design. Prepare for these to change weekly.</p><br>

    <h2>Cube Setup in Rhino</h2>
    <p>Let's jump into it. Shoutout to Nathan for the help. Rhino file is a basic cube using cube in the command line and ensuring 
      it was 2cm by 2cm. File: <a href="a3_cube.3dm" download>Rhino Cube, file type .3dm</a></p>
    <p>Here's the source design for cubes made on Rhino and exported into UltiMaker Cura</p>

    <h2>Cubes</h2>
  <p> File: <a href="Assignment3_Cube.3mf" download>Cura Cube, file type .3dm</a></p>
  <p>A 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" settings were extra fast, took 8 minutes to print with a height of 20.11mm and width of 20.27 mm</p>
  <p>A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings were fine, took 20 minutes to print with a height of 20.03mm and width of 20.03mm</p>
  <p>A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings took 1 hour 8 minutes to print with a height of 20.04mm and width of 20.05mm</p>
  <br><div class="image-container">
    <img src="a3_cube1.png"><img src="a3_cube2.jpg"><img src="a3_cube3.jpg"></div>
  <br><p>As a side note, I had jumped to the tube before coming back to the second cube so I accidentally printed without walls. The plus side is I caught on to this great UX. Shoutout Cura team for making it easy to manually print via USB.</p>
  <br><img src="a3_cube_UX.png">
  <br><p>Finally, a 2 cm cube with a <strong>concentric top and bottom</strong> layer and my favorite print setting from the previous cubes. My favorite 
    setting at the moment is the one that gets done the fastest since this doesn't need to piece together with anything.
    The standard "low quality" settings were extra fast, took 14 minutes to print with a height of 19.99mm and width of 20.27 mm.
  </p><br>

  <p>Well, I did it. I'm not sure what it means though. Concentric x 1 on the right, left is one of the standard cubes.</p>

  <h2>Tubes</h2>
  <p>To make a tube, I used the cylinder command in Rhino, 
    exported it, opened the file in Cura, and removed the top + bottom walls. The process made me realize Cura's interface is very inviting and easy to use. </p>
  <p><br>A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness<br>
    Time (min): 8min <br>Height (mm): 29.94<br>Width (mm): 30.16

    <p><br>A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a double extrusion 
      wall thickness and random z-seam alignment<br>
      Time (min): forgot to record <br>Height (mm): 29.63<br>Width (mm): 30.05

    <h2>Cylinder</h2>
    <p>Here's the documentation for the last two pieces:</p>

    <h2>Clips</h2>
    <p>I need 15 clips that can hold cardboard.</p>
    <br><p>Here's a clip from Thingiverse that I printed to test out. It passed the shake test but it is not my design.</p>
