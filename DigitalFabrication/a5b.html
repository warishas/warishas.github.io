        <h2>Lamp Design Process</h2>
        <p>My tube design from last week was not executed strategically, so I approached this week with a fresh start. I already had a mood board inspired by Tullum, Mexico, and knew I wanted a similar, open concept lamp to ensure light would come through the PLA.</p>
        <p>For this assignment, I took advice from my peers and downloaded Fusion 360. After sketching out my design, I utilized various tools in Fusion 360 to create a detailed 3D model of the lamp, ensuring that it would be structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
        <p>Once the design was finalized, I prepared it for 3D printing. This involved checking for any potential issues such as overhangs or thin walls that might cause printing problems. I then exported the design as an STL file, ready for the next step. Huge shoutout to the Audesk fusion Youtube channel for such a helpful tutorial.</p>

        <p>One thing I did differently this time from previous disasterous assignments was sit down, take measurements, and think through how pieces would fit together, such as how the lamp would hang or how a bulb would be changed.</p>

        <h2>3D Printing a Lampshade</h2>
        <p>
            With the STL file prepared, I moved on to the 3D printing process. Using my Ender printer, I loaded the file into the printer's software and adjusted settings such as layer height and infill density to achieve the desired print quality and strength.

            My printer has a spot where the prints constantly get tangled so I slowed my print down for course to normal on Cura and moved the whole model to the left of the cura
            board in hopes my live print would follow suit. I think the axis is off on my board because left aligning on the board meant center on my printer and center on the cura board is right aligner on my printer.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the printer completed its work, I carefully removed the printed lamp from the build plate, removed any support structures, and did some minor post-processing to clean up any rough edges or imperfections.<br /><br />
            This print is in process, going on to hour 12 with an estimated 1.25 hours to go.

        <h2>Mold Design Process</h2>
        <p>I downloaded a mold of a fight club soap bar from Thingiverse by a user named utoudabi.
        Then, I pulled the STL into Autodesk Fusion. I extruded around to create a new body, then split it. I resized it on Cura to make it small and print asap.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The final result was a beautifully crafted lamp that perfectly captured the essence of my initial inspiration. This project not only honed my skills in CAD design and 3D printing but also taught me valuable lessons in creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail. It stands proudly as a testament to my growth as a designer and maker.</p>
