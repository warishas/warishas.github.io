      <h2> Getting Started</h2>
    </div>
    <p>As will be my practice going forward, I started by test fitting a gauge. It should have been simple but I realized I don't know how to use calipers so this was a long process that didn't need to be. Eventually I narrowed it down to .15 inches<br>.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Here was the process leading up to it. I also found that the laser cutter didn't approve of a 0.1 stroke and wouldn't cut until I changed it to 0.01.</p>

      <h2> Modeling</h2>
    </div>
    <p><br>I already had the vision of an equilateral traingle due to its even length on each side, and got to work. I kept adjusting the laster cutter settings thinking that my cut wasn't going through the cardboard and that is why the cutouts were so small but eventually, I realized I placed the cutouts pertruding out of the triangle instead of cutting into the shape.</p>

      <h2> Cutting</h2>
    </div>
    <p><br>After multiple rounds of cutting and recutting, I was down to my last piece of cardboard. Due to the bend, it required a bit more power to effectively cut through those parts and I landed on the following laser cutter settings.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I got it done. Here is the documentation</p>
