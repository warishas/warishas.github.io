                            I divided my responsibility into two categories. The first, provide guidance and direction that would keep the team progressing against the rapid timelines.

                            The second was to provide critique and industry knowledge that would challenge their product and add value within the market.

                            <strong>Live One-On-One Mock Interviews:</strong> InnerView facilitated live, one-on-one mock interviews to help students practice and refine their interviewing skills. This feature allowed students to gain confidence and readiness for real job interviews.

                            My role was to provide guidance as the technology team navigated the design sprint for their product - from discovery to prototype - which I did over two weekly team meetings for planning and co-working as well as regular check-ins over Slack. While the team was not selected as a top project, the collaboration amongst the team stood out and was lauded by the jury.
