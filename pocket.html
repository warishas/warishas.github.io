                            Seattle’s only designated “National Treasure” is not the Space Needle,
                            Starbucks or Russell Wilson. It’s the six-story Panama Hotel
                            many Seattle residents know little — if anything — about. Pocket
                            Tour aims to change that.

                            The first Asians to settle in Seattle were Chinese laborers in
                            the late 18th century. By the mid 19th century, it was not
                            uncommon to see working men wearing Levi's denim workwear that
                            transitioned into today's blue jeans. Combining old and new,
                            we're sharing POC stories through the device in your jeans.

                            In a time where anti-Asian hate is still prevalent, there is a lack of knowledge of how deeply Asian-American history is woven into the city.
                            The Wing Luke Museum is positioned as an excellent educational resource yet there has been a 23% decrease in museum visitors between the ages of 18 to 24 yet this demographic visited science museums at an 11% rate increase. As a team, we speculated the following <strong>pain points </strong>to explain this:
                            <br> <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. low interaction makes the experience boring

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. tours require an allotted time commitment limiting flexibility

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. lack of variation leaves little to explore in a following visit

                            <br>
                            The challenge was using the real world as part of my canvas.
                            Outside variables required me to think about Pocket Tour beyond digital
                            interactions as it adds to a physical space. It was almost like
                            designing two experiences: one for looking directly at the device and
                            one for looking through the device at an artifact. After my team member
                            almost walked into the street without looking up to see if cars were approaching,
                            I became acutely aware that my first priority as a designer should be road
                            safety instead of screen appeal. This is particularly important because AR users need to be aware of their
                            surroundings - especially when near streets or around other people.
                            <br><br>I also learned that designing for accessibility cannot be an afterthought. If I want a product to be accessible,
                            I need to address that from the get-go so that <strong>
                                features are designed with our target
                                population, not for them.
                            </strong> I realized this when I considered adding audio for road safety and making
                            wheelchair accessible tours by crafting specific routes for the tour
                            instead of exploring a way to automate it, which I would if I had more time to work on this project.

                            <br><br> <strong>TLDR:</strong> Designers need to consider interactions from multiple perspectives. In AR,
                            one of those angles is how the user interacts with their
                            phone and their environment - sometimes (but not always) at the same time.
