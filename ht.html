                            Innovators in the nonprofit space often work in silos, slowing down progress when people around the world are working towards the same sustainable development goals (SDGs).
                            As the design and partnership lead, I explored the potential of mapping to create and share knowledge, promote collaboration, and facilitate social activism.<br><br>
                            The result: an 85% increase in digital engagement, innovation crowdsourced from
                            63 countries, and an official partnership with the United Nations.

                            To explore this, I began by crafting a persona for nonprofit professionals, social entrepreneurs, and anyone
                            interested in creating social impact - ultimately deciding on the archetype I would have the most access to:
                            conference presenters and attendees.

                            During the early days of the Global Action Mosaic product, our CEO and I were cognizant that the majority of the innovation crowdsourcing was done at the Solutions Summit. Maya represents one of the ordinary people doing extraordinary things we have met and would continue to meet. With this insight in mind, we developed a platform that was easy to use, even for non-technical users, while still offering advanced features that incorporated artificial intelligence. <br><br>

                            The user journey for Global Action Mosaic builds on Humanitarian Tracker's existing technology, starting with the user's decision to map their work. Once the user decides to share their project on the GAM platform, they navigate through the reporting process, which has been simplified to make it user-friendly. The reported data is then automatically categorized and mapped through machine learning algorithms. Finally, the user can visualize and analyze the reported data through interactive maps, graphs, or pursue details for a specific innovation.

                            <br>
                            My design decisions were guided by the need to simplify the reporting process, improve data visualization and analysis, and foster partnerships with organizations and individuals. We incorporated several features, including a simplified reporting process, automatic categorization and mapping, interactive data visualization, and a partnership network. The team prototyped and tested the platform, adding features to help users visualize and analyze the data and incorporating machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize and map the reported data.

                            To ensure that we were achieving our goals and making progress towards our desired outcomes, I established the following key metrics:

                            By simplifying the reporting process, improving data visualization and
                            analysis, and fostering partnerships with organizations and individuals, we were able to increase
                            impact but the lesson for me was knowing how to tap into our audience.
                            <br><br>My biggest lesson was that a great product is only useful to those who know how to find it.
                            Partnerships were crucial here.
